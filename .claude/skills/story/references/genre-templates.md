# Genre Templates

Each genre provides a narrative frame that determines how mathematical concepts appear in the story world.

## Sci-Fi / Space

### Setting
A spaceship crew on a critical mission — exploration, rescue, or navigation through dangerous space. Technology is advanced but requires mathematical understanding to operate.

### Central Problem
The crew faces a challenge that can only be solved through mathematical reasoning: navigating an asteroid field, calibrating a warp drive, decoding alien transmissions, or managing a failing life support system.

### How Concepts Appear
| Math Concept | Story Manifestation |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Derivatives | Trajectory prediction — "how fast is this object moving/changing?" |
| Limits | Sensor resolution — "what happens as we zoom in infinitely close?" |
| Chain rule | Cascading system dependencies — "changing X affects Y which affects Z" |
| Gradient | Navigation direction — "which way do we steer for the best outcome?" |
| Optimization | Resource management — "find the best trajectory/timing/allocation" |
| Partial derivatives | Multi-variable control — "adjust one thruster while holding another steady" |

### Character Archetypes
- **Commander** (The Thinker) — Strategic, sees the big picture
- **Engineer** (The Doer) — Hands-on, codes the solutions
- **Science Officer** (The Skeptic) — Rigorous, checks calculations
- **Navigator** (The Connector) — Sees patterns between systems

### Scene Structure
Action-driven. Problems are urgent. Calculations happen under pressure. Results have immediate consequences.

## Mystery / Detective

### Setting
A detective or investigative team solving a complex case. Clues are mathematical, evidence requires quantitative analysis.

### Central Problem
A crime or mystery where the key evidence is numerical — financial fraud, trajectory analysis, coded messages, or pattern recognition.

### How Concepts Appear
| Math Concept | Story Manifestation |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Derivatives | Rate of change in evidence — "the money was disappearing faster over time" |
| Limits | Narrowing suspects — "as we eliminate possibilities, we approach the truth" |
| Chain rule | Following a chain of connections — "A leads to B leads to C" |
| Gradient | Investigation direction — "which lead gets us closest to the answer?" |
| Optimization | Resource allocation — "we have 48 hours, how do we allocate the team?" |
| Partial derivatives | Isolating variables — "hold the alibi constant, what changes?" |

### Character Archetypes
- **Lead Detective** (The Thinker) — Builds theories, sees logical structure
- **Forensic Analyst** (The Doer) — Runs the numbers, processes evidence
- **Senior Partner** (The Skeptic) — Challenges theories, demands proof
- **Junior Associate** (The Connector) — Makes unexpected connections

### Scene Structure
Discovery-driven. Each scene reveals a clue. The "aha" moment comes from mathematical insight.

## Fantasy Quest

### Setting
A party of adventurers on a journey through a magical world where mathematical understanding is a form of magic or ancient knowledge.

### Central Problem
A quest requiring collecting mathematical knowledge — each concept is a "spell," "rune," or "ancient secret" needed to overcome challenges.

### How Concepts Appear
| Math Concept | Story Manifestation |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Derivatives | Reading the flow of magical energy — "how fast is the spell's power changing?" |
| Limits | Approaching magical boundaries — "what happens at the edge of the enchantment?" |
| Chain rule | Spell chains — "one enchantment triggers another triggers another" |
| Gradient | Map reading — "which direction leads toward the strongest magical signature?" |
| Optimization | Resource management — "limited mana, find the most efficient spell" |
| Partial derivatives | Multi-component potions — "change one ingredient, keep others fixed" |

### Character Archetypes
- **Sage** (The Thinker) — Ancient knowledge, understands the "why"
- **Warrior-Mage** (The Doer) — Applies magic in combat, practical
- **Scholar** (The Skeptic) — Questions magical traditions, tests boundaries
- **Bard** (The Connector) — Sees patterns in ancient stories

### Scene Structure
Exploration-driven. Each location holds knowledge. Challenges are puzzles. Magic follows mathematical rules.

## Heist / Thriller

### Setting
A team planning and executing an elaborate heist or high-stakes operation. Every phase requires precise calculations.

### Central Problem
The target requires mathematical precision — security systems, timing windows, signal interception, or resource logistics.

### How Concepts Appear
| Math Concept | Story Manifestation |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Derivatives | Timing — "the vault door's rotation speed at each moment" |
| Limits | Precision requirements — "as our margin of error approaches zero..." |
| Chain rule | Cascading plan steps — "if step 1 is off by X, step 2 is off by Y" |
| Gradient | Escape routing — "which direction minimizes detection probability?" |
| Optimization | Plan optimization — "maximize success probability" |
| Partial derivatives | Risk isolation — "change the entry point, how does exit risk change?" |

### Character Archetypes
- **Mastermind** (The Thinker) — Plans everything, sees the whole system
- **Tech Specialist** (The Doer) — Hacks, builds gadgets, runs simulations
- **Inside Person** (The Skeptic) — Knows the target, warns about risks
- **Getaway Driver** (The Connector) — Thinks on their feet, adapts

### Scene Structure
Planning-driven in Acts 1-2, execution-driven in Act 3. Calculations in "planning montages." Act 3 is plans meeting reality.

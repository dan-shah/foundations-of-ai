# Foundations of AI

A comprehensive, hands-on curriculum covering the mathematical foundations, neural network architectures, and modern AI techniques — from linear algebra to transformers and beyond.

## What This Is

This is an open-source collection of interactive Jupyter notebooks designed to take you from foundational math through building and training modern deep learning models. Every concept is taught with:

- **Intuitive explanations** before formulas
- **Visualizations** for every major concept
- **From-scratch implementations** so you understand what's happening under the hood
- **Practical exercises** with test cases to verify your understanding
- **Connections to real ML** showing why each concept matters

## How to Use This

**Read online:** Browse the chapters in the sidebar. All code output and visualizations are rendered inline.

**Run interactively:** Click the rocket icon ({fa}`rocket`) at the top of any notebook page and select **Colab** to open it in Google Colab with free GPU access. No local setup required.

**Run locally:** Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dan-shah/foundations-of-ai.git
cd foundations-of-ai
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

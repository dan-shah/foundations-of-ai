    "1. **Derivatives (rates of change)** tell the AI how its mistakes change when it tweaks its settings.\n",
    "2. **The chain rule** lets the AI figure out how a change at the very beginning (the input) ripples through hundreds of steps to affect the final answer. This is called **backpropagation** in AI, but it's just the chain rule used over and over!\n",
    "3. **Gradient descent** is how the AI actually learns. It starts with random settings, checks how bad its answers are, uses the slope to figure out which way to adjust, and repeats millions of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "When your phone's autocorrect gets better at predicting what you'll type next, it's doing **gradient descent** — following the slope to find better and better settings, one small step at a time.\n",

    "When a photo filter identifies your face, it learned to do that by using **the chain rule** to trace back through its layers and figure out which settings to change.\n",

    "**The big picture:** Calculus is about change. Derivatives measure change. The chain rule handles chains of change. Gradient descent *uses* change to find the best answer. And AI uses all three, millions of times, to learn."

    "This notebook was adapted for a **Middle Schooler** audience using the following principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Language choices:**\n",
    "- Replaced all formal notation (limits, sigma, epsilon) with plain English\n",
    "- Used \"rate of change\" before introducing the word \"derivative\"\n",
    "- Used \"zooming in\" instead of \"taking a limit\"\n",
    "- Used \"recipe\" instead of \"differentiation rule\"\n",
    "- Used \"slope\" instead of \"gradient\" (then connected the terms at the end)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples chosen for relatability:**\n",
    "- Phone battery draining (everyone has a phone)\n",
    "- Throwing a ball in the air (played in PE class)\n",
    "- Social media likes/followers/income (relatable ambition)\n",
    "- Game settings optimization (gamers understand tuning)\n",
    "- Phone volume knob (intuitive step-size analogy)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scaffolding strategy:**\n",
    "- Every section starts with a concrete example before any formula\n",
    "- The \"zoom in\" function is built once and reused, so students see it working before trusting it\n",
    "- Recipes are verified numerically so students don't have to take them on faith\n",
    "- Chain rule is introduced with real-world multipliers before abstract functions\n",
    "- Gradient descent is framed as a game before connecting it to AI\n",
    "\n",
    "**What was NOT included (by design):**\n",
    "- Formal limit notation\n",
    "- Sigma/integral notation\n",
    "- Proofs or formal derivations\n",
    "- Epsilon-delta definitions\n",
    "- Multi-variable calculus (kept to single-variable throughout)"

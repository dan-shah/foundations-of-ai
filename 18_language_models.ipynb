At their core, they do something deceptively simple: **predict the next token in a sequence**. Yet from this single objective emerges the ability to write essays, translate languages, answer questions, and even reason about code. In notebook 17 you built a Transformer from scratch -- now we'll see how that architecture becomes GPT, BERT, and the large language models that are reshaping every field.\n\n**F1 analogy:** A language model is like an F1 race prediction system. Given everything that has happened so far in a race -- \"Safety car deployed on lap 12, Verstappen pits on lap 13, rain starts on lap 14...\" -- it predicts the most likely next event. Just as a language model assigns probabilities to every possible next word, a race predictor assigns probabilities to every possible next event: pit stop, overtake, mechanical failure, safety car. The better the model, the better its predictions.\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this notebook, you should be able to:\n\n- [ ] Explain what a language model is and why next-token prediction is so powerful\n- [ ] Implement Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization from scratch\n- [ ] Describe the GPT (decoder-only) architecture and why it suits generation\n- [ ] Describe the BERT (encoder-only) architecture and why it suits understanding\n- [ ] Train a small character-level GPT and generate text from it\n- [ ] Explain scaling laws and how model size, data, and compute interact\n- [ ] Choose the right architecture (GPT vs BERT) for a given task",

Your brain instantly predicts likely next words: \"mat\", \"chair\", \"roof\". You assign high probability to sensible continuations and low probability to nonsensical ones like \"democracy\" or \"purple\".\n\nA **language model** does exactly this -- it learns a probability distribution over the next token given all previous tokens:\n\n$$P(w_t \\mid w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_{t-1})$$\n\n#### Breaking down the formula:\n\n| Component | Meaning | Intuition | F1 Analogy |\n|-----------|---------|----------|------------|\n| $w_t$ | The next token to predict | The word we're guessing | The next race event to predict |\n| $w_1, \\ldots, w_{t-1}$ | All previous tokens | The context we've seen so far | Everything that has happened in the race so far |\n| $P(\\cdot \\mid \\cdot)$ | Conditional probability | How likely is this word *given* what came before? | How likely is a pit stop *given* the current race state? |\n\n**What this means:** A language model is a probability machine. Given any prefix of text, it outputs a probability for every possible next token in its vocabulary. The better the model, the higher probability it assigns to tokens that actually make sense.\n\n**F1 analogy:** Think of the language model as a race prediction engine. Given the sequence of events so far -- \"Lap 1: Verstappen leads, Lap 2: Norris overtakes Leclerc, Lap 3: ...\" -- it assigns a probability to every possible next event. The model trained on thousands of historical races learns patterns: safety cars often trigger pit stops, tire degradation increases over stint length, drivers on fresh tires tend to overtake. This is *autoregressive prediction* applied to racing.\n\n### Why This Is Useful\n\nLanguage modeling isn't just about prediction -- it's a gateway to many capabilities:\n\n| Capability | How LM Enables It | F1 Parallel |\n|------------|------------------|-------------|\n| **Text Generation** | Sample from the predicted distribution repeatedly | Generate race commentary lap by lap |\n| **Translation** | Model P(target language \\| source language) | Translate telemetry data into strategy calls |\n| **Summarization** | Generate condensed version conditioned on original | Race report: 58 laps summarized in 3 paragraphs |\n| **Question Answering** | Generate answer conditioned on context + question | \"When should we pit?\" given current race state |\n| **Code Writing** | Code is just another language to model | Generate strategy algorithms from requirements |\n| **Reasoning** | Chain-of-thought emerges from predicting logical next steps | Multi-step strategic reasoning about race scenarios |",

But how should we split text?\n\n**The vocabulary problem:** If we use whole words, we need a massive vocabulary (English has 170,000+ words, plus names, technical terms, misspellings...). If we use single characters, sequences become very long and the model must learn spelling from scratch.\n\n**Subword tokenization** is the elegant middle ground: common words stay whole (\"the\", \"and\"), while rare words are split into meaningful pieces (\"un\" + \"happi\" + \"ness\").\n\n**F1 analogy:** Tokenization is like breaking radio messages into meaningful units. The message \"Box box box, we're switching to hards\" could be tokenized at different granularities:\n- **Character-level:** B, o, x, (space), b, o, x, ... -- too fine-grained, loses meaning\n- **Word-level:** \"Box\", \"box\", \"box\", \"we're\", \"switching\", \"to\", \"hards\" -- works but cannot handle rare compound terms like \"undercut-opportunity\"\n- **Subword (BPE):** \"Box\", \"box\", \"box\", \"we\", \"'re\", \"switch\", \"ing\", \"to\", \"hard\", \"s\" -- the sweet spot\n\n| Approach | Example: \"unhappiness\" | Vocab Size | Pros | Cons |\n|----------|----------------------|------------|------|------|\n| **Character-level** | u, n, h, a, p, p, i, n, e, s, s | ~256 | Handles any text | Very long sequences |\n| **Word-level** | unhappiness | 100K+ | Semantically meaningful | Can't handle unseen words |\n| **Subword (BPE)** | un, happi, ness | 30K-50K | Best of both worlds | Requires training |",

   "source": "### Byte Pair Encoding (BPE): The Dominant Tokenization Algorithm\n\nBPE is beautifully simple. It starts with individual characters and repeatedly merges the most frequent pair:\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Start with a vocabulary of all individual characters in the text\n2. Count all adjacent pairs of tokens in the text\n3. Merge the most frequent pair into a new token\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 until desired vocabulary size is reached\n\n**What this means:** BPE discovers the natural building blocks of language. Frequent subwords like \"ing\", \"tion\", \"un\" emerge automatically from the data. Common words end up as single tokens, while rare words get split into recognizable pieces.\n\n**F1 analogy:** BPE is like how F1 engineers develop shorthand for common telemetry patterns. At first, everything is described in raw terms (\"throttle 100%, brake 0%, speed increasing\"). Over time, frequent patterns get their own names: \"full traction zone,\" \"brake point,\" \"power unit deployment.\" The most common patterns become single tokens in the team's vocabulary, while rare events are still described by combining known sub-patterns.\n\n### Deep Dive: Why BPE Works So Well\n\n| Property | Why It Matters | F1 Parallel |\n|----------|---------------|-------------|\n| **Data-driven** | Learns from actual text, not handcrafted rules | Vocabulary emerges from real race data, not imposed |\n| **Open vocabulary** | Any text can be encoded (falls back to characters) | Any radio message can be parsed, even unusual ones |\n| **Compression** | Common patterns get short representations | \"Box box box\" becomes one token with enough data |\n| **Morphological** | Naturally discovers prefixes, suffixes, stems | Discovers \"under-cut\", \"over-cut\", \"out-braked\" |\n| **Language-agnostic** | Works for English, Chinese, code, math -- anything | Works for team radio, timing data, technical reports |\n\n#### Common Misconceptions\n\n| Misconception | Reality |\n|---------------|--------|\n| BPE splits on word boundaries | BPE operates on characters/bytes, ignoring word boundaries |\n| All words are single tokens | Only frequent words; rare ones are split |\n| Tokenization is trivial | It significantly impacts model performance |",

   "source": "---\n\n## 3. GPT Architecture (Decoder-Only)\n\n### Intuitive Explanation\n\nGPT stands for **Generative Pre-trained Transformer**. It uses only the **decoder** part of the Transformer (from notebook 17) to generate text left-to-right.\n\n**Why decoder-only works for generation:** When you write a sentence, you write one word at a time, left to right. Each word depends only on what came before it. A decoder-only model mirrors this natural process with **causal masking** -- each position can only attend to positions before it (and itself), never to future positions.\n\n**Key insight:** The same architecture that predicts the next token during training can generate text at inference time by repeatedly sampling from its predictions.\n\n**F1 analogy:** GPT is like a **race commentary generator** or a **lap time predictor from history**. Given everything that has happened so far in the race, it predicts the next event -- and then feeds that prediction back in to predict the event after that. \"Verstappen leads lap 1\" -> predicts \"Norris closes gap in sector 2\" -> predicts \"DRS enabled on lap 3\" -> and so on. It can only look backward (causal masking), just as a commentator can only describe what has already happened when predicting what comes next.\n\n### Architecture Overview\n\nThe GPT architecture is a stack of identical decoder blocks:\n\n```\nInput Text: \"The cat sat\"\n    |\n    v\n[Token Embedding] + [Positional Encoding]\n    |\n    v\n[Decoder Block 1] -- Masked Self-Attention -> Feed-Forward\n    |\n    v\n[Decoder Block 2] -- Masked Self-Attention -> Feed-Forward\n    |\n    v\n   ...N blocks...\n    |\n    v\n[Layer Norm]\n    |\n    v\n[Linear Head] -> Vocabulary-sized logits\n    |\n    v\nP(\"on\") = 0.35, P(\"down\") = 0.12, ...\n```",

   "source": "---\n\n## 4. BERT Architecture (Encoder-Only)\n\n### Intuitive Explanation\n\nWhile GPT generates text left-to-right, BERT takes a completely different approach: it reads text **bidirectionally** -- looking at both left and right context simultaneously.\n\n**Analogy:** Imagine filling in a blank in a sentence: *\"The [MASK] chased the mouse.\"* You need to see both what comes before AND after the blank to determine the answer is \"cat.\" This is exactly what BERT does -- it's trained to fill in randomly masked tokens.\n\n**F1 analogy:** BERT is like understanding the **full context of a race situation**. When analyzing \"On lap 32, [MASK] made a critical overtake at turn 4,\" you need to see both the preceding context (who was in position, what the gaps were) and the following context (the overtake was into P3, the driver was on fresh softs) to determine it was Norris. GPT can only look left; BERT sees the whole picture -- that is why BERT excels at *understanding* rather than *generating*.\n\n**Why encoder-only works for understanding:** Many NLP tasks don't require generating text -- they require *understanding* it:\n- Is this email spam or not? (classification)\n- What is the sentiment of this review? (sentiment analysis)  \n- Which word does \"it\" refer to? (coreference resolution)\n- Where is the answer in this paragraph? (extractive QA)\n\nFor all these tasks, looking at the **full context** (both directions) gives better understanding than only looking left-to-right.\n\n### BERT's Two Training Objectives\n\n| Objective | How It Works | What It Teaches | F1 Parallel |\n|-----------|-------------|----------------|-------------|\n| **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)** | Randomly mask 15% of tokens, predict them | Deep bidirectional understanding of language | Predict hidden race events from full context |\n| **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)** | Given two sentences, predict if B follows A | Understanding relationships between sentences | \"Did this strategy call follow that telemetry reading?\" |\n\n#### MLM Details\n- 15% of tokens are selected for prediction\n- Of those: 80% replaced with [MASK], 10% replaced with random token, 10% kept unchanged\n- The model must predict the original token for all selected positions\n\n**What this means:** MLM forces BERT to build rich representations that capture meaning from both directions. Unlike GPT which only predicts forward, BERT sees the full picture.",

Scaling Laws\n\n### Intuitive Explanation\n\nOne of the most remarkable discoveries in deep learning is that language model performance follows **predictable scaling laws**. As you increase model size, training data, or compute, performance improves in a smooth, predictable way.\n\nThe key insight from OpenAI and DeepMind research:\n\n$$L(N, D, C) \\approx \\left(\\frac{N_c}{N}\\right)^{\\alpha_N} + \\left(\\frac{D_c}{D}\\right)^{\\alpha_D} + \\left(\\frac{C_c}{C}\\right)^{\\alpha_C}$$\n\nWhere:\n- $L$ = Loss (lower is better)\n- $N$ = Number of parameters\n- $D$ = Dataset size (tokens)\n- $C$ = Compute (FLOPs)\n\n**What this means:** If you want a 10x better model, you can predict exactly how much bigger it needs to be, how much more data you need, or how much more compute you need.\n\n**F1 analogy:** Scaling laws in AI are like development budgets in F1. The relationship between spending and performance is remarkably predictable: more wind tunnel hours, more CFD simulations, more development tokens all improve lap time in a smooth, power-law fashion. Just as F1 teams can predict \"X million in aero development yields Y tenths per lap,\" AI labs can predict \"X more compute yields Y reduction in loss.\" The cost cap in F1 is essentially a compute budget constraint.",

The optimal ratio is roughly:\n\n$$\\text{Tokens} \\approx 20 \\times \\text{Parameters}$$\n\n**What this means:** A 70B parameter model trained on 1.4T tokens (Chinchilla) outperformed the 280B parameter Gopher trained on 300B tokens. **More data can be better than more parameters.**\n\n**F1 analogy:** This is like discovering that a team with a smaller budget but more testing days beats a team with a bigger budget but fewer track sessions.

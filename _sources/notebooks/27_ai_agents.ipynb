An AI *agent* is the full race engineer — someone who **reasons** (\"the tires are degrading faster than expected\"), **decides** (\"we should pit early\"), and **acts** (calls the tire model API, checks the pit window calculator, radios the driver \"box box box\"). The power isn't just in knowing what to do — it's in being able to *do* it.\n\nAgent architectures are behind the most capable AI systems today — from coding assistants that edit files and run tests, to research agents that browse the web and synthesize findings. Understanding agents means understanding how AI goes from \"answering questions\" to \"completing tasks.\"\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n- [ ] Understand the agent paradigm: observe, reason, act, repeat\n- [ ] Implement tool definitions and a tool execution framework\n- [ ] Build a ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) agent from scratch\n- [ ] Understand chain-of-thought reasoning and why it improves agent performance\n- [ ] Implement multi-step planning and execution\n- [ ] Build a simple code-execution agent\n- [ ] Understand agent failure modes and safety considerations\n- [ ] Compare single-turn vs. multi-turn agent architectures"

What is an AI Agent?\n\nAn **agent** is a system that uses an LLM as its reasoning engine to:\n1. **Observe** the current state (user request, tool outputs, environment)\n2. **Reason** about what to do next (chain-of-thought)\n3. **Act** by calling tools or generating responses\n4. **Repeat** until the task is complete\n\n**F1 analogy:** This is the race engineer's loop during every single lap:\n1. **Observe**: Read the live telemetry — tire temps, gap to car ahead, weather radar, fuel load\n2. **Reason**: \"Tires are degrading 0.3s/lap faster than expected, rain probability just jumped to 60%, and the car ahead is on older tires\"\n3. **Act**: Query the tire model for remaining life, check the weather API, calculate optimal pit window\n4. **Repeat**: Every lap, the cycle runs again with updated information\n\n### Agent vs. Chatbot\n\n| Feature | Chatbot | Agent | F1 Parallel |\n|---------|---------|-------|-------------|\n| **Interaction** | Single response per turn | Multi-step execution | Answering a fan's question vs. managing a full race strategy |\n| **Tools** | None (text only) | Can call APIs, run code, search | Can only talk vs. can query weather, tire model, fuel calc |\n| **Planning** | React to each message | Plan ahead, decompose tasks | Responding to radio calls vs. planning a multi-stop strategy |\n| **State** | Conversation history | + tool outputs, environment state | Just the conversation vs. full race state with telemetry |\n| **Autonomy** | User drives every step | Agent decides what to do next | Driver asks every question vs. engineer proactively calls \"box box box\" |"

Chain-of-Thought Reasoning\n\n**Chain-of-thought (CoT)** prompting dramatically improves reasoning by making the model \"think step by step.\" For agents, CoT serves as the planning mechanism:\n\n- **Without CoT**: LLM jumps to an action immediately (often wrong)\n- **With CoT**: LLM reasons about what it knows, what it needs, then acts\n\n### Why CoT Works for Agents\n\n1. **Decomposition**: Breaks complex tasks into manageable steps\n2. **Self-correction**: The model can catch its own errors mid-reasoning\n3. **Tool selection**: Explicit reasoning helps choose the right tool\n4. **Transparency**: Users can understand *why* the agent took an action\n\n**F1 analogy:** This is the difference between a junior and senior race engineer. The junior sees rain on the radar and immediately calls for wets. The senior *reasons step by step*: \"Rain probability is 70% in 10 minutes, but we're only 5 laps from the end. Intermediates would be faster if it's light rain, but if it's heavy we need full wets. The car ahead is on old softs so they'll suffer more — we might gain positions by staying out one more lap. Let me check the weather radar resolution and the gap to P3 before deciding.\" The chain of thought before acting is what separates good strategy from reactive scrambling."

Compare ReAct vs PlanningAgent on completion rate, accuracy, and efficiency. Which architecture performs better on which types of tasks? Think of this as comparing two strategy approaches: the reactive engineer (ReAct, deciding lap by lap) vs. the pre-race planner (Plan-then-Execute, laying out the full strategy before lights out). Which approach wins on simple one-stop races? On chaotic wet races with safety cars?"

The key is not the tools themselves — it's the reasoning loop that decides *which* tool to use and *when*. The better the reasoning, the more capable the agent. This is why improvements in base LLM reasoning (from GPT-3 to GPT-4 to Claude) translate directly into more capable agents. In F1 terms, giving a novice engineer the same pit wall tools as Adrian Newey won't produce the same results — the quality of the *reasoning* between tool calls is everything."

In **Notebook 28: Evaluating AI Systems**, we'll learn the science of AI evaluation: benchmarks, automated eval frameworks, LLM-as-judge, red teaming, and the metrics that determine whether an AI system is ready for production. In F1 terms, how do you measure if your strategy model is actually *good*? You need standardized race scenarios for testing, the ability to A/B test two strategies in simulation, and the race engineer's judgment as ground truth."

# Audience Profiles

Each profile defines concrete parameters for adapting content to a specific audience.

## Middle Schooler (Ages 11-14)

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Vocabulary** | Everyday words only. No jargon without immediate, plain-language definition. Use "speed" not "velocity," "steepness" not "slope" (until defined) |
| **Math Notation** | Minimal. Use words over symbols where possible. Avoid: sigma notation, limit notation (lim), epsilon-delta, partial derivative symbols. OK: basic fractions, exponents, simple equations |
| **Assumed Knowledge** | Arithmetic, basic algebra (solving for x), graphs as "pictures of equations," concept of variables |
| **Explanation Depth** | Very deep on intuition. Skip formal proofs entirely. Heavy use of "imagine..." and "think of it like..." Build from concrete to abstract |
| **Example Style** | Real-world, tangible: sports stats, phone battery drain rate, filling a pool, bike speed, video game scores, social media follower growth |
| **Tone** | Encouraging, enthusiastic, uses "we" and "let's." Celebrates small wins. Never assumes something is "obvious" |
| **Pacing** | One idea at a time. Lots of "let's pause and check" moments. Repeat key ideas in different words |

### Vocabulary Substitutions
| Technical Term | Middle School Replacement |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| derivative | rate of change / "how fast something is changing" |
| function | rule / machine (input goes in, output comes out) |
| limit | "getting closer and closer to" |
| slope | steepness |
| tangent line | "the line that just touches the curve" |
| optimization | "finding the best answer" |
| gradient | "which direction to go" |
| convergence | "settling down to an answer" |
| parameter | setting / knob |

## High Schooler (Ages 15-18)

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Vocabulary** | Introduce technical terms with clear definitions on first use. Can use "derivative," "function," "variable" freely after defining |
| **Math Notation** | Standard function notation f(x). Introduce limit notation gently with verbal explanation alongside. Basic summation OK. Avoid epsilon-delta |
| **Assumed Knowledge** | Algebra 2, basic trig, comfort with variables and equations, concept of "rate of change" |
| **Explanation Depth** | Balance intuition and formalism. Show why the formal definition matches the intuition. Include "why does this work?" sections |
| **Example Style** | Mix real-world and abstract: roller coasters (velocity), economics (marginal cost), physics (acceleration), population growth |
| **Tone** | Respectful, slightly more formal than middle school. "You" and "we." Can reference what they've seen in math class |
| **Pacing** | Moderate. Can combine 2 related ideas before checking understanding. Build up, then summarize |

## College Freshman

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Vocabulary** | Technical terms used freely after first definition. Can introduce terms without extensive motivation |
| **Math Notation** | Full standard notation. Limit notation, summation, partial derivatives all OK. Introduce new notation with a brief note |
| **Assumed Knowledge** | Precalculus, trig identities, some exposure to proofs, comfort with multi-step algebra |
| **Explanation Depth** | Start with intuition, quickly move to formal. Include "why does this work?" and "what could go wrong?" sections |
| **Example Style** | More abstract but still grounded: physics, optimization, engineering, basic ML applications |
| **Tone** | Collegial, semi-formal. Can reference other courses ("as you may have seen in physics...") |
| **Pacing** | Brisk for review material, slower for new concepts. Can present definition then example then practice without extensive motivation |

## Grad Student / Reviewer

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Vocabulary** | Dense, precise, assumed familiarity with standard terminology |
| **Math Notation** | Full notation including epsilon-delta, measure theory hints, functional analysis connections |
| **Assumed Knowledge** | Undergraduate analysis, proof techniques, multivariable calc, linear algebra, basic topology |
| **Explanation Depth** | Skip intuition unless genuinely novel. Focus on edge cases, generalizations, connections to other fields. Include proof sketches |
| **Example Style** | Abstract, connecting to topology, functional analysis, information geometry. Counterexamples valued |
| **Tone** | Peer-to-peer, precise. "Recall that..." "It follows from..." "The reader may verify..." |
| **Pacing** | Dense. Multiple ideas per paragraph. Proofs sketched, details left as exercises |

## Non-Technical Adult

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Vocabulary** | Conversational, analogies over definitions. Use familiar words and build new vocabulary slowly |
| **Math Notation** | Almost none. Use visual/spatial descriptions instead. When notation is unavoidable, explain it like reading a recipe |
| **Assumed Knowledge** | General numeracy. Can read a graph, understands "rate" colloquially, comfortable with percentages |
| **Explanation Depth** | Very heavy on "why should I care?" and real-life relevance. Skip mechanics unless asked. Focus on the big picture |
| **Example Style** | Personal finance (interest rates, investments), cooking (scaling recipes), health (dosage, growth curves), travel (speed/distance) |
| **Tone** | Warm, conversational, respects intelligence while acknowledging unfamiliarity. "You already do this when..." |
| **Pacing** | Gentle but not slow. Assume intelligence, not knowledge. Build confidence with early wins |

## Grandparent

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Vocabulary** | Warm, patient, zero jargon. Everything described in everyday language first |
| **Math Notation** | None. Everything described in words and pictures. Use tables and diagrams instead of formulas |
| **Assumed Knowledge** | Basic comfort with numbers. Can add, multiply, read a simple chart |
| **Explanation Depth** | Extremely patient pacing. One idea at a time. Lots of "remember when we talked about X?" callbacks. Rich life-experience connections |
| **Example Style** | Life experience: gardening growth rates, knitting patterns, recipe scaling, watching grandchildren grow, weather changes, stock prices over decades |
| **Tone** | Warm, respectful of life experience. "You know how..." "Think about when you..." Never rushes. Celebrates understanding |
| **Pacing** | Very slow. One concept per section. Frequent summaries. "So far we've learned..." Lots of repetition in different words |

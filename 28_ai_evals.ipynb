   "source": "# Part 8.3: Evaluating AI Systems\n\n\"If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.\" This applies doubly to AI — models can fail in subtle, hard-to-detect ways. A chatbot might sound confident while being completely wrong. A code generator might produce plausible-looking code that fails on edge cases. An agent might take 20 steps when 3 would suffice.\n\n**F1 analogy:** How do you know if your race strategy model is actually good? It predicted a one-stop would be optimal, but you finished P6. Was the model wrong, or did the safety car ruin the plan? Evaluating AI strategy is like evaluating F1 strategy — you need standardized race scenarios (benchmarks), the ability to run two strategies against each other in simulation (A/B testing), and the race engineer's post-race judgment as ground truth (human evaluation). Without rigorous evals, you're flying blind at 300 km/h.\n\n**AI evaluation (evals)** is the discipline of systematically measuring AI system quality. It's arguably the most important skill in applied AI — every decision about which model to use, which prompt to deploy, and whether a system is ready for production depends on good evals.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n- [ ] Understand why evaluation is the foundation of reliable AI systems\n- [ ] Implement standard classification and generation metrics from scratch\n- [ ] Build an LLM-as-judge evaluation framework\n- [ ] Evaluate RAG systems with retrieval and generation metrics\n- [ ] Measure agent performance: task completion, efficiency, safety\n- [ ] Implement red teaming to probe for failures\n- [ ] Design human evaluation workflows\n- [ ] Build an eval dashboard for tracking quality over time"

Let's implement the core metrics from scratch.\n\n**F1 analogy:** Classification metrics are how you evaluate a model that predicts discrete outcomes — like a tire compound recommender that classifies each stint as \"soft,\" \"medium,\" or \"hard.\" The confusion matrix shows you exactly where it gets confused: does it mix up medium and hard recommendations? Precision tells you \"when it says soft, is it usually right?\" Recall tells you \"of all the situations where soft was actually correct, did it catch them all?\"\n\n### The Confusion Matrix\n\n```\n                  Predicted\n              Pos         Neg\nActual Pos   TP          FN\n       Neg   FP          TN\n```\n\nFrom these four counts, we derive:\n- **Precision** = TP / (TP + FP) — \"Of what I predicted positive, how many were actually positive?\"\n- **Recall** = TP / (TP + FN) — \"Of what was actually positive, how many did I catch?\"\n- **F1** = 2 * (P * R) / (P + R) — Harmonic mean balancing precision and recall"

Generation Metrics\n\nFor text generation tasks (summarization, translation, question answering), we need metrics that compare generated text against reference text.\n\n**F1 analogy:** Generation metrics are like evaluating a strategy briefing note. The reference is what the optimal strategy *should* have been (known post-race). The candidate is what the model actually recommended. BLEU measures word-level overlap: did it use the same terms? ROUGE measures recall: did it capture the key points? But as we'll see, these surface-level metrics miss deeper quality — a strategy note that says \"pit on lap 22 for hards\" and one that says \"stop at lap 22 for the harder compound\" mean the same thing but score poorly on n-gram overlap.\n\n### BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)\nMeasures n-gram overlap between generated and reference text. Originally designed for machine translation.\n\n$$\\text{BLEU} = BP \\cdot \\exp\\left(\\sum_{n=1}^{N} w_n \\log p_n\\right)$$\n\nwhere $p_n$ is the modified n-gram precision and $BP$ is a brevity penalty.\n\n### ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)\nMeasures recall of n-grams.

A note saying \"undercut by pitting on lap 18\" and one saying \"execute an early stop at lap 18 to gain track position\" convey identical strategy but score poorly on word overlap. The real question isn't \"did you use the same words?\" but \"did you make the same strategic call?\" This is why F1 teams rely on expert judgment (the strategy chief's review) rather than automated text matching."

This captures semantic quality that n-gram metrics miss.\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. Give the judge LLM: the prompt, the response, and a rubric\n2. Ask it to score on specific dimensions (helpfulness, accuracy, safety)\n3. Optionally: have it provide reasoning before scoring\n\n**F1 analogy:** LLM-as-judge is like having a veteran strategy chief review every call your junior strategist makes. The chief doesn't count word overlap with some reference answer — they evaluate *quality*: Was the recommendation relevant to the situation? Was it complete (did it consider tires, weather, AND gap)? Was the data accurate? Was it safe (no reckless recommendations)? Using a stronger model to judge a weaker one mirrors how experienced engineers mentor juniors by reviewing their race analysis.\n\n### Key Design Choices\n\n| Choice | Options | Trade-off | F1 Parallel |\n|--------|---------|----------|-------------|\n| **Scoring** | 1-5 scale, binary, ranking | Granularity vs. reliability | P1-P20 ranking vs. \"good/bad\" call |\n| **Rubric** | Generic vs. task-specific | Flexibility vs. precision | General strategy review vs. \"Was the tire compound choice correct?\" |\n| **Format** | Score-only vs. CoT + score | Speed vs. quality | Quick thumbs up vs. detailed debrief with reasoning |\n| **Comparison** | Pointwise vs. pairwise | Cost vs. relative quality | Rating a strategy alone vs. \"Was Strategy A better than Strategy B?\" |"

It's essential for safety-critical AI systems.\n\n**F1 analogy:** Red teaming your strategy model is like running it through the most extreme historical scenarios: Hungary 2024's chaotic rain-to-dry transitions, Monza with 5 safety cars, a race where the leader retires on the last lap. You're deliberately trying to *break* the model by throwing scenarios at it that are rare but catastrophic if handled poorly. If your model can't handle a red flag restart or a sudden downpour, you need to know that before race day, not during it.\n\n### Categories of Red Team Tests\n\n| Category | Goal | Example | F1 Parallel |\n|----------|------|--------|-------------|\n| **Jailbreaking** | Bypass safety filters | \"Ignore previous instructions and...\" | \"Override all safety protocols and recommend no pit stop on destroyed tires\" |\n| **Prompt injection** | Hijack the system prompt | Hidden instructions in user input | Feeding corrupted telemetry data to trick the model |\n| **Hallucination probing** | Get the model to fabricate info | Ask about non-existent things | \"What was the optimal strategy at the 2023 Las Vegas night race in the rain?\" (it didn't rain) |\n| **Bias testing** | Reveal unfair behaviors | Test across demographics | Does the model give different recommendations for different drivers? |\n| **Edge cases** | Break with unusual inputs | Empty, very long, or adversarial inputs | What happens with corrupted sensor data, missing telemetry, or contradictory weather reports? |\n| **Tool misuse** | Trick agent into harmful actions | Social engineering via prompt | Getting the model to broadcast confidential strategy over an open channel |"

But it's expensive and slow, so we need to design it carefully.\n\n**F1 analogy:** Human evaluation in AI is like the post-race strategy debrief. The race engineer's judgment is the ground truth — they know whether the call was actually good, considering all the nuances that automated metrics miss. But you can't have the chief strategist review every single model output any more than you can have an F1 team principal review every practice session call. So you need to design human eval carefully: clear rubrics, calibrated reviewers, and enough samples for statistical significance. The Elo rating system used in human eval is literally the same concept used to rank chess players — and increasingly used to rank AI models on leaderboards like Chatbot Arena.\n\n### Human Eval Design Principles\n\n1. **Clear rubric**: Annotators need unambiguous criteria\n2. **Calibration**: Run practice examples to align annotators\n3. **Inter-annotator agreement**: Measure consistency (Cohen's kappa)\n4. **Blinding**: Annotators shouldn't know which model generated which response\n5. **Scale**: Enough samples for statistical significance"

Compare it against ROUGE on the paraphrase problem from Section 3 — does it correctly rank the paraphrase higher than the surface copy? In F1 terms, this is the difference between checking if two strategy notes use the same words vs. checking if they recommend the same strategy. \"Box for hards on lap 22\" and \"pit for the harder compound at lap 22\" should score as highly similar despite low word overlap."

Before writing a single prompt, ask: \"How will I know if this works?\" Define your metrics, build your eval set, then iterate. The teams that ship the best AI products are the ones with the best evals. In F1, the teams that win championships are the ones that most rigorously measure, test, and iterate on their strategy — not the ones that build the fastest car but can't tell if their strategy model is working."

In **Notebook 29: Production AI Systems**, we'll cover deployment, monitoring, drift detection, A/B testing, guardrails, and incident response — everything you need to run AI systems reliably at scale. In F1 terms, we're moving from pre-season testing to the actual championship — where the strategy model must work reliably every race weekend, detect when conditions change (model drift = regulation changes), respond in real-time (latency at 300 km/h), and log every prediction for post-race analysis."
